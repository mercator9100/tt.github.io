# Why this website?

Since 2022 Europe has been going through one the most violent and lethal armed conflicts since the second World War. Received opinion has it that this war was unprovoked, and that Russia must and can be defeated. There are numerous important intellectuals and thinkers, however, who do not think history started in 2022, but well before that, and that a proper consideration of historical context should lead to a re-evaluation of that rather simplistic picture. This website aims to present an overview of these dissident voices. There is no exaggeration involved in calling them dissident. No mainstream medium ever interviews one of these voices, invites them for an opinion piece, gives them a platform, or allows them to be heard in any way, shape, or form. This stifling intellectual climate is one of the most astounding things I have ever come across, and I struggle to come to grips with it. [Thomas Fazi](https://www.thomasfazi.com/) has devoted some [interesting reflections](https://www.thomasfazi.com/p/the-wests-century-long-war-against-cc1) to this question, where he sees the present war as the continuation of a centuries-long war of the West against Russia. There is obviously much more to say about this question, but that is for another time. 

The sources I list below are the ones I have been consulting on a regular basis over the past years, and that have been able to engage my continued attention. Others have fallen by the wayside, either because I stopped taking them seriously, or because they do not add sufficient novel perspective over and above the ones already read, or simply because I find the style of writing not engaging.

Several authors write for the site, but her own pieces are very sharp and to the point.

## [Craig Murray](https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/)

A former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, who denounced the human rights violations of the Karimov regime. The British government could not appreciate this and fired him. As a former member of the British establishment, he knows well the ins and outs of international law and politics. He has reported extensively on the Julian Assange case, following the court case against him in Britain from close by. In 2021 he was sentenced to eight months in prison for contempt of court related to his reporting on the trial of former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who was acquitted of multiple sexual assault charges in 2020. During 2025, he reported from Lebanon with the help of Laith Marouf of [Free Palestine TV](https://www.freepalestine.video/), but the rather prohibitive cost associated with such an undertaking has stalled that effort. He is politically active as an advocate of Scottish indepence.

He writes lengthy pieces, some of which go nowhere, while others always tell you something interesting about the inside story behind recent historical events.

## [Chris Hedges](https://chrishedges.substack.com/)

## [Arnaud Bertrand](https://arnaudbertrand.substack.com/)

A French national living in China, and an absolute must-read for anything related to China, and beyond. Unfortunately, many of his posts are paywalled, but he also has an account on X @RnaudBertrand, which is well worth following.

# Podcasts

## [Dialogue Works](https://www.youtube.com/@dialogueworks01)

A podcast hosted by Nima Alkorshid, an Iranian living in Brazil. His regular guests include the following:

### Chas Freeman

Former US diplomat, worked as the main interpreter for Richard Nixon during his 1972 China visit and served as the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1989 to 1992. Very sharp intellect, very erudite and knowledgeable, very critical of US foreign policy.

### Larry Wilkerson

A retired United States Army Colonel and former chief of staff to United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. With Ray McGovern, he is a member of [Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran_Intelligence_Professionals_for_Sanity).

### [Scott Ritter](https://scottritter.substack.com/)

Former US marine and weapons inspector in the Soviet Union and Iraq. Scott Ritter has made it his mission to improve the understanding between the peoples of the US and Russia, and makes regular trips to Russia, and interviews leading Russian voices on his show. A lot of that is paywalled though.

### [Michael Hudson](http://michael-hudson.com/)

Economist who argues that the main purpose mainstream economic theory  is to obfuscate reality. His insights are really eye-opening. He makes a distinction bewteen industrial capitalism (which he considers a good and productive force, which will eventually lead to socialism) and finance capitalism, which is a parasite that produces nothing and lives off the work of others.

In this classic piece [America’s Real Adversaries Are Its European and Other Allies](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/02/michael-hudson-americas-real-adversaries-are-its-european-and-other-allies.html) Hudson argues that the war in Ukraine is part of a broader US strategy aimed at preventing its Western allies from developing mutually beneficial commercial and cooperation ties with Russia and China.

His 2022 article [Germany’s Position in America’s New World Order](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/11/michael-hudson-germanys-position-in-americas-new-world-order.html) likens the position of democracies across the world to Pope Gregory VII's papal dictates requiring kings to subordinate themselves to Rome. In the same way, elected rulers or governments have to subordinate themselves to Washington at the peril of being branded dictators who have come to power through illegitimate, stolen, or otherwise fradulous elections. 

### Jacques Baud

Former Swiss intelligence officer, who worked in Ukraine at the time of the Maidan events in the frame of the NATO Partnership for Peace. He has written a number of books, which show his knowledge to stem from personal experience. He bases himself exclusively on Western sources for his books. Some excerpts and interviews are to be found on [The Postil Magazine](https://www.thepostil.com/), which defines its mission as `to work for the return of Christendom'. Because his views deviate from the mainstream, he has come into the crosshairs of [the EU sanctions machine](https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/12/eu-sanctions-swiss-intelligence-expert-jacques-baud.html).

## Judge Napolitano: [Judging Freedom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDkEYb-TXJVWLvOokshtlsw)

Andreew Napolitano is a former judge and Fox News commentator, who knows how to interview a guest, and keep a conversations short and to the point. Regular guests include Larry Wilkerson, Scott Ritter, John Mearsheimer, Larry Johnson, as well as the following: 

### [Jeffrey Sachs](https://www.jeffsachs.org/)

An economist and top-level advisor to several US governments. He was one of the `Harvard Boys', a group of advisers charged with transforming the communist economies of Eastern Europe and Russia to capitalism. He claims that his recommendations for stabilising the economy were followed in the case of Poland, but ignored in the case of Russia. He was the head of a *The Lancet*’s COVID-19 commission, charged, among other things, with finding out the origin of the COVID19 virus. He believes some scientists on the commission were [rather too eager](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/covid-lab-leak-theory-jeffrey-sachs-peter-daszak.html) to conclude that the virus must have come from a market in Wuhan, and not out of a laboratory there, which was carrying out gain-of-function research, i.e. research into how viruses can be made to be deadlier or more transmissible, with the purported aim of being better prepared should such gain of function ever occur in nature.

### Ray McGovern
Former CIA analyst and adviser, chair of the National Intelligence Estimates under the Ronald Reagan administration, responsible for the President's Daily Brief. 

### Douglas McGregor 
Retired colonel of the US Army, fought in the Gulf War and was a top planner in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia

### Alastair Crooke 

Former MI6 and European diplomat.

## [John Mearsheimer](https://mearsheimer.substack.com/)

John Mearsheimer is a leading US political scientist of the realist school, which holds that geopolitics is driven by the self-interest of powerful nations, rather than by moral or legal considerations. He does not so much have his own podcast, but he is a regular guest on those of other people. His substack page keeps a faithful record of those appearances.
